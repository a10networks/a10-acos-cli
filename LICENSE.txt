any unpaid balance on Customer’s account. Interest will not accrue on advance payments or deposits unless required by law. Based on Customer’s
creditworthiness as A10 determines it, Al0 may establish a credit limit and restrict Products, Support, or features. If Customer’s account balance goes
beyond the limit A10 sets for Customer, A10 may immediately interrupt or suspend the provision of Products until Customer’s outstanding balance is
brought below the credit limit. Any charges Customer incurs in excess of Customer’s limit become immediately due. If Customer has more than one

party. A10 will have sole control of the defense or settlement negotiations, and A10 agrees to pay, subject to the limitations set forth below, any final
judgment entered against Customer, as a result of such infringement by a Product, in any such Claim defended by A10; provided that: (1) A10 is given
prompt written notice of any such Claim and (2) Customer reasonably cooperates with A10 in such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, A10 shall

except that Customer will not settle any such Claim without A10 Parties' prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld. A10 will give
Customer reasonable notice of each Claim for which it or an A10 Party wants indemnity, except that failure to provide such notice will not release

EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS, PROFITS OR ABILITY TO
EXECUTE) OR FOR THE COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY
CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND
WHETHER OR NOT A10 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING
LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO
HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT LIMITS OR EXCLUDES ANY LIABILITY THAT
CANNOT BE LIMITED OR EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS CUMULATIVE AND
NOT PER INCIDENT.

6. Confidentiality.

6.1 Duty of Care. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential
information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to protect Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Receiving Party will (1) not
use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement, and (2) except as otherwise
authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its affiliates’
employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who are subject to confidentiality obligations
to the Receiving Party not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein. Neither party will disclose the terms
of this Agreement or any Order to any third party other than its affiliates, legal counsel, and accountants without the other party's prior
written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its affiliate, legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for
such affiliate's, legal counsel's or accountant's compliance with this Article ("Confidentiality"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Al0 may
disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order toa subcontractor, sub-processor, or other entity that is working with Al0 to the
extent necessary to enable A10 to perform A10's obligations to Customer under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective
as set forth herein.

6.2 Compelled Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to
do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and
reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is
compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is
a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable
cost of complying and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.

6.3 Injunctive Relief. It is understood and agreed that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, a breach by either party of Article 12
may cause the other party irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages might be inadequate, and that the other party shall therefore be
entitled to seek timely injunctive relief, without posting bond, to protect such party’s rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all remedies
available at law.

7. Term and Termination.

7.1 Term. Licenses granted under this Agreement remain in effect for the applicable Usage Term or Trial Term (the “Term”), unless earlier terminated
in accordance with this Agreement. Customer may terminate the license at any time by destroying all copies of the Products in Customer possession or
control, provided that termination will not abate any amounts due A10 under an Order. The license granted under this Agreement will automatically
terminate, with or without notice from A10, upon completion of the relevant Term, if Customer breaches any term of this Agreement or exceeds the
scope of the license granted herein. Upon termination, Customer must at A10’s option, either promptly destroy or return to A10 all copies of the
Software and Documentation in Customer possession or control.

7.1.1 Termination for Breach. In the event of a material breach by either Party of this Agreement or any Order, the non-breaching Party shall have the
right to terminate the applicable Order or this Agreement, in such Party’s sole discretion, for cause if such breach has not been cured within thirty (30)
days of written notice from the non-breaching Party specifying the breach in detail. A10 may immediately terminate this Agreement and/or Customer's
password, account, and access to Services if (i) Customer fails to make payment due within ten (10) business days after A10 has provided Customer
with notice of such failure; or (ii) Customer violates Sections 1, 2, 3, 6, or 8 of this Agreement. If A10 terminates an Order for Customer's material
breach, all fees set forth on such Order are immediately due and payable.

7.1.2 Termination for Insolvency. Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately at its option if the other Party (i) ceases to do business in
the normal course; (ii) becomes or is declared insolvent or bankrupt; (iii) is the subject of any proceeding related to its liquidation or insolvency (whether
voluntary or involuntary) which is not dismissed within ninety (90) days; or (iv) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors.

 

7.2 Effect of Termination

7.2.1 Software. Upon any termination or expiration of an Order or this Agreement, Customer's right to access and use Software and Documentation
covered by that Order or this Agreement, as applicable, shall terminate.

7.2.2 Customer Data. Customer acknowledges and agrees that A10 has no obligation to retain Customer data and that A10 may, in its sole discretion,
and without notice to Customer, irretrievably delete and destroy Customer data after the termination of the Agreement.

7.2.3 Services and Software. The right to access Support and the license to the Software will automatically terminate upon termination of this
Agreement, the relevant Usage Term or the applicable Order for any reason. Upon such termination, Customer must, at A10’s option, either
promptly destroy or return to A10 all copies of the Software and Documentation in Customer’s possession or control.

7.3 Suspension. A10 reserves the right to temporarily suspend or permanently terminate use of or access to Support by Customer or User(s) in the event
that (i) Customer or such User(s) violates, or is deemed by A10, in A10’s sole determination to be in violation of the terms of this Agreement, (ii) uses
Support in a manner that A10 reasonably believes will cause it liability, or (iii) A10 does not timely receive payment from the Customer or, as applicable,
the channel partner, that purchased Support from A10. Customer also remains responsible for paying Customer’s monthly Support fee if Support is
suspended as permitted herein.

7.4 Survival. The following provisions will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13 and 15.

8 Compliance with Laws. Customer agrees to comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in connection
with its activities under this Agreement. Customer specifically avers and agrees that Customer has not received or been offered any illegal or improper
bribe, kickback, payment, gift, or thing of value from any of A10's employees or agents in connection with this Agreement.

9 Export Administration Act and Related Laws. The Products and technology (hereafter referred to as Software and Technology) supplied
by A10 under the Agreement are subject to export controls under the laws and regulations of the United States and any other applicable countries’ laws
and regulations. Customer shall be responsible for being knowledgeable as to all laws, regulations, and requirements regarding the export, re-export,
transfer, diversion, release and/or import of the Software and Technology and any other A10 items (whether tangible or intangible, including without
limitation commodities, software, technology, and technical data) that Customer may receive or access under this Agreement. Customer, at its cost,
agrees to conduct all activities and obligations under this Agreement in conformity with such laws, regulations, and requirements. In addition, Customer
understands and agrees that A10's Software and Technology shall not, in the absence of authorization by United States and local law and regulations,
as required, be used by or exported or re-exported to (i) any United States sanctioned or embargoed country, or to foreign nationals or residents of such
countries; or (ii) any person, entity, organization or other party identified on the United States Department of Commerce's Denied Persons or Entity
Lists, the United States Department of Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the Department of State's Debarred
Parties List, as published and revised from time to time; (iii) any party engaged in nuclear, chemical/biological weapons or missile proliferation
activities; or (iv) any party for use in the design, development, or production of rocket systems or unmanned air vehicles. Customer warrants and
represents that it is not (i) a person, entity, organization, or other party identified on the United States Department of Commerce's Denied Persons or
Entity List, the United States Department of Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the Department of State's Debarred
Parties List, as published and revised from time to time. A10 reserves the right in its sole discretion to deny acc: r use of the Software or Services to
any of the foregoing entities, without any liability or any other obligation hereunder to Customer or any other third party.

 

10 Identified Components; Additional Terms. The Products and Appliances may contain or be delivered with one or more components,
which may include third-party components, as may be identified by A10 in the documentation, readme.txt file, third-party click-accept or elsewhere
(e.g. on www.al Onetworks.com) (the “Identified Component(s)”) as being subject to different license and/or agreement terms, disclaimers of warranties,
limited warranties or other terms and conditions (collectively, “Additional Terms”) than those set forth herein. Customer agrees to the applicable
Additional Terms for any such Identified Component(s).

11 Open Source Statement. The Software includes “Open Source Software” that is licensed pursuant to the Open Source Software license
agreement(s) identified in the Open Source Software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header(s) provided with or otherwise
associated with the Software. Additional detail may be provided (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation, or within the user
interface of the device, if any. With respect to Open Source Software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede,
the terms of any applicable Open Source Software license agreement.

12 General. Without regard to or application of conflict of laws rules or principles: (a) this Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California without reference to its conflict of laws rules; and (b) any disputes, claims, or causes of action arising
out of or related to this Agreement or Customer's use of the Products will be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and
exclusively by the state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) will not apply. Customer may not assign or transfer this Agreement,
or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without A10's prior written consent, and any attempt by Customer to do so, without
such consent, will be void. A10 may assign or transfer this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without Customer's consent. Except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under
this Agreement or otherwise. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement
of that or any other provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be enforced to the maximum
extent possible, and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement and all Order(s) are the complete and exclusive
understanding and agreement between the parties regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all proposals, understandings, or communications between
the parties, oral or written, regarding its subject matter. Any terms or conditions contained in Customer's purchase order or other ordering document
that are inconsistent with or in addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement are hereby rejected by A10 and will be deemed null. In the event
of a conflict between this Agreement and an Order, the terms of this Agreement shall control. Except for payment obligations, neither party will be
liable for inadequate performance to the extent caused by a condition that was beyond the party's reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, act
of war or terrorism, riot, labor condition, governmental action, and Internet disturbance). There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. A10
may use third party contractors to perform some or all of A10's obligations under this Agreement provided that A10 will be responsible for such
performance. The original of this Agreement is in English and Customer waives any right to have it written in any other language. Any use of the plural
in this Agreement shall also imply the singular and vice-versa, as appropriate.

13 U.S. Government Customers. The software elements of Products and Documentation are deemed to be “commercial computer software”
and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212(b), as applicable.
Consistent with FAR 12.211, FAR 12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7102-1 through 227.7102-4 and 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, and
notwithstanding any other FAR or other contractual clause to the contrary in any agreement into which the Agreement may be incorporated, Customer
may provide to U.S. Government Customers or, if the Agreement is direct, U.S. Government Customer will acquire, the software elements of Products
and Documentation with only those rights set forth in the Agreement. Use of either the software elements of Products or Documentation constitutes
agreement by the U.S. Government that the items are "technical data," "commercial computer software" or "commercial computer software
documentation," and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions herein.
